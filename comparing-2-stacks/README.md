## Comparing two stacks

<h2>Description:</h2>

In this task we are going to compare two stacks

if they have same numbers at same order.

   <h3>Files:</h3>

**stack.h**: A header file contains all structs and functions declaration
using in thi task.

**main.c**: Contains main function where we check our code.

**pop.c**: Contains function that deletes nodes from a stack.

**push.c**: Contains function that adds nodes from a stack.

**compare.c**: contains function that compare two stacks and return 1 if they are, otherwise 0

<h2>Explanation:</h2>

We need to compare each time the first number at the top.

If the size of the two stack is not the same: we return false

else we check each node of each stack.
