   <h3>Files:</h3>

**stack.h**: A header file contains all structs and functions declaration
using in thi task.

**main.c**: Contains main function where we check our code.

**pop.c**: Contains function that delete nodes from a stack.

**push.c**: Contains function that add nodes from a stack.

We need to compare each time the first number at the top.

If the size of the two stack is not the same: we return false
